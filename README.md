# spring_boot_demos
This is a repo of projects built following the [Spring Boot tutorials](https://spring.io/guides#getting-started-guides). 
I put these together as I learned about the Spring Framework. I am storing them for future reference. Anyone is welcome to use them as a guide etc. The links to the tutorials
at the time they were done can be found in the readme of each project. If I found the tutorial was missing information or otherwise out of date, I included that info in the file
readme as well.

Enjoy,
C Jordan Bigelow
